## Hi there 👋
My name is Kristin. I'm a physical oceanographer with expertise in ocean observations, data processing, and analysis. My research focuses on large-scale ocean circulation and climate variability on seasonal to longer timescales. I have broad experience analyzing multiplatform datasets, including in-situ ocean observations, reanalysis products, and outputs from ocean general circulation and climate models.

- 🔭 I'm part of a team monitoring the North Atlantic Current in the Rockall Trough—have a look at the [Ellet Array](https://scotmarphys.github.io/ScotMarPhys.OSNAP-Mooring-Processing.io/).
- 🌍 The Ellet Array is part of a larger initiative: the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program—check out [OSNAP](https://www.o-snap.org/).
- 🗒️ You can find a full list of my publications, reports, and conference contributions on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tA7ggMAAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.
